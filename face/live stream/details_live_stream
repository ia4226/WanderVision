live stream and detections
- needed to set up python 3.9 virtual environment for live stream.
- python 3.12 does not support dlib = 19.24.6 and numpy = 2.0+ for face recognition
- downgraded from 3.12 to 3.9 in virtual environment. 
- installed dlib =19.24.0 and numpy = 1.22 and face recognition in terminal of PyC and opencv-python, packages can be added from PyC by clicking "ctrl + ,"

Faster face detection
- operates less loops. lesser frames, improves performance and latency for a single face, while aslo detecting unown face. 

integration
  1. automation of the process leads to faster, more error prone process.
  2. dynamically appending items in dataset helps in improving and managing scalability.
